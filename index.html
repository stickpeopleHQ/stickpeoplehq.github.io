<h1>We have wrapped up Stick People</h1>
  <h2>We helped to make service more people-centred.</h2>
  <p>We started Stick People as a consultancy to help teams, organisations and communities grow their service design and digital capabilities.</p>
  <p>Between 2015 and 2021, we did this by coaching, training and co-designing, always with an element of skills transfer.</p>
  <p>We wrapped up Stick People when founders, Kathryn Grace and Matt Edgar, moved on to other work.</p>
